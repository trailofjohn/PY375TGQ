# The Feynman Physics of V1: "Time Gets Heavy"

*Transcribed from the lecture "Physics of the Real World"*

**"Last time, we pretended gravity was simple. We were wrong."**

Remember our spaceship? In V0, we said "Gravity pulls it." And "The clock is broken."
Well, in V1, we grew up. We realized that the Universe is much stranger than Isaac Newton thought.

## 1. The Clock Isn't Broken. It's *Dilated*.
In V0, we simulated the clock drifting like a drunk walker. Random.
In V1, the clock is sober. It's just... heavy.

Einstein tells us two things:
1.  **If you move fast, time slows down.** ($v^2/c^2$)
2.  **If you are near a heavy object, time slows down.** ($GM/r$)

So in V1, we calculate this **Proper Time** ($\tau$).
When the probe dives towards the Sun (Scenario C), it's moving at 100 km/s. That's fast! And it's deep in the gravity well.
The computer calculates:
$$ "My \ 1 \ second" = "Earth's \ 1.00000001 \ seconds" $$
It doesn't sound like much, but over a year? You miss your appointment by seconds. In navigation, that means you miss the planet by thousands of kilometers.

## 2. The Doppler Effect: "I can hear how fast you are."
In V0, we played "Marco Polo" (Range).
*   "Where are you?" -> "Here!" (10 minutes later).

In V1, we listen to the *pitch* of the voice.
Imagine a train coming at you. *Neee-ooo-www*. High pitch coming, low pitch going.
The radio signal does the same.
$$ \Delta f \approx \frac{v}{c} f_0 $$
Our filter now measures this pitch. It knows your speed *instantly*. It doesn't have to wait for you to move to see a change. This makes the blue line "snap" to the green line much faster.

## 3. The Lie of "Now" (Light-Time)
In V0, we cheated. We looked at where the planet *is*.
But if you look at Jupiter, you aren't seeing Jupiter. You're seeing a ghost of Jupiter from 40 minutes ago.
In V1, we fix this. We use a **Light-Time Solver**.
"I see the probe at angle X. But the probe was actually there 20 minutes ago. So where was it *really*?"
We work backwards. It's like shooting a duck—you don't aim where the duck is, you aim where the duck *was*... wait, no, you aim where it *will be*.
Navigation is just Time Travel math.

**Summary for V1:**
We stopped pretending time is universal. We track the Probe's Time, the Signal's Time, and Earth's Time separately. And that is why V1 works.
